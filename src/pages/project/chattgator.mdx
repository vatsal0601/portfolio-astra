## ChattGator

## What is ChattGator?

ChattGator is the perfect tool for developers looking to add chat support to their existing web applications. With ChattGator, developers can easily add a customizable chat UI to their applications, and get started with chat support quickly and easily. ChattGator is also an NPM package, so it's perfect for businesses with existing web applications who are looking to add chat support without having to code it from scratch. _You can read the full PRD of the project from [here](https://vatsalsakariya.notion.site/PRD-c3e18a3ba8dc496681bd8dcc9851c605)._

## How ChattGator was made?

We first started by exploring how others are solving this problem and how we can solve this problem in more efficient way. Then we started by creating the PRD of the project. After we knew what we were building we then moved to the design and exploration part of the project by diving the project in frontend and backend.

### Frontend

In the frontend we started of by making wireframes of the project and then moving on to Figma for designing the actual UI.

Here are glimpse of the wireframes and the UIs which we created:

### Backend

In the backend we started of by creating the LLD of the overall project. In this phase we decided things like which language the backend should be made in, the database to use and the API structure. _You can see the full LLD design [here](https://vatsalsakariya.notion.site/Database-and-Schema-8bbb43d94a4c41a2bbfbb102ba38a5a2)_
